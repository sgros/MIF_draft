                     Implementation of PvD support
               draft-sgros-dhcp-and-ipr-claim-analysis-00

Abstract

   The purpose of this draft is to document two implementations that
   tried to implement PvD architecture document.  One implementation was
   done from scratch while another is a part of an existing component
   (NetworkManager).

1.  Introduction

   TBD.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  pvd_man implementation

2.4.  Experiences gained

   Present some experience gained from the implementation.  What do you
   think was good?  What would you do differently if you were to
   implement this again.  What about language/environment, was it good,
   what was bad?

3.  NetworkManager implementation

   TBD.

4.  Server component

   Server side component of the MIF architecture implementation
   described in this document is Router Advertisements Daemon (radvd).
   radvd is used to announce PvD configuration data to the clients using
   NDP protocol.  This alows clients to autoconfigure their network
   parameters related to different PvDs.  For the purpose of MIF
   architecture implementation, existing structure of Router
   Advertisements (RA) message is extended with new NDP option that
   encapsulates PvD-related network configuration information as
   suboptions.  To configure what PvD-related network configuration
   information to include into RA messages, radvd configuration file is
   extended with new configuration block where PvD-related network
   configuration information are specified.

   Proposed extension of the Router Advertisement Daemon is backward
   compatible with the non-PvD-aware version of radvd.  This means that
   old clients will continue to work normally, except that they will not
   be able to configure PvD-related network information on their network
   interfaces.  New option introduced into the RA messages is silently
   ignored by non-PvD-aware clients if they are implemented correctly.

4.1.  Router Advertisements (RA) message extension

   PvD-aware version of radvd supports the inclusion of network
   parameters that belong to explicitly identified provisioning domains
   into the Router Advertisements (RA) messages.  Explicitly identified
   provisioning domain is a set of consistent network configuration
   parameters identified by unique provisioning domain identifier (PvD
   ID).  To carry PvD-related network configuration information, the
   structure of the Router Advertisements (RA) message is extended with
   new NDP option called Provisioning Domains Container Option (PVD_CO).
   The structure of the PVD_CO option is defined in [....].  PVD_CO is a
   container option which means it encapsulates other NDP options.  The
   following NDP options

5.  Acknowledgements

   TBW.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

   All drafts are required to have an IANA considerations section (see
   the update of RFC 2434 [I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis]
   for a guide).  If the draft does not require IANA to do anything, the
   section contains an explicit statement that this is the case (as
   above).  If there are no requirements for IANA, the section will be
   removed during conversion into an RFC by the RFC Editor.

7.  Security Considerations

   All drafts are required to have a security considerations section.
   See RFC 3552 [RFC3552] for a guide.
