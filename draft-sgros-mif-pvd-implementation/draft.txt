                     Implementation of PvD support
               draft-sgros-dhcp-and-ipr-claim-analysis-00

Abstract

   The purpose of this draft is to document two implementations that
   tried to implement PvD architecture document.  One implementation was
   done from scratch while another is a part of an existing component
   (NetworkManager).

2.4.  Experiences gained

   Present some experience gained from the implementation.  What do you
   think was good?  What would you do differently if you were to
   implement this again.  What about language/environment, was it good,
   what was bad?

3.  NetworkManager implementation

   TBD.

4.  Server component

   Server side component of the MIF architecture implementation
   described in this document is Router Advertisements Daemon (radvd).
   radvd is used to announce PvD configuration data to the clients using
   NDP protocol.  PvD-aware radvd extension alows clients to
   autoconfigure their network parameters related to multiple PvDs
   simultaneously.  For the purpose of MIF architecture implementation,
   existing structure of Router Advertisements (RA) message is extended
   with new NDP option that encapsulates PvD-related network
   configuration information as suboptions.  To configure what PvD-
   related network configuration information to include into RA
   messages, radvd configuration file is extended with new configuration
   block where PvD-related network configuration information are
   specified.

   Proposed extension of the Router Advertisement Daemon is backward
   compatible with the non-PvD-aware version of radvd.  This means that
   old clients will continue to work normally, except that they will not
   be able to configure PvD-related network information on their network
   interfaces.  New option introduced into the RA message is silently
   ignored by non-PvD-aware clients if they are implemented correctly.

4.1.  Router Advertisements (RA) message extension

   PvD-aware version of radvd supports the inclusion of network
   parameters that belong to explicitly identified provisioning domains
   into the Router Advertisements (RA) messages.  Explicitly identified
   provisioning domain is a set of consistent network configuration
   parameters identified by unique provisioning domain identifier (PvD
   ID).

   To carry PvD-related network configuration information, the structure
   of the RA message is extended with new NDP option called Provisioning
   Domains Container option (PVD_CO), as described in [...].  PVD_CO is
   a container option, which means it encapsulates other NDP options.
   NDP options nested within the PVD_CO option describe particular PvD-

   related network configuration information.  All information the
   belong to a single PvD which are part of a single network
   autoconfiguration procedure are nested within the same PVD_CO option.
   If a single RA message contains network configuration information
   from multiple sources, multiple PVD_CO options are present in such
   message.  Therefore, RA message MAY contain zero or more PVD_CO
   options, one per PvD announced in RA message.  Figure 1 shows the
   structure of the PVD_CO option used in proposed MIF architecture
   implementation.

                          Figure 1: PVD_CO option

   In this experimental implementation, the type of the option is set to
   63.  Option length is calculated depending on the length of the
   encapsulated options.  The values of the S flag and Name Type field
   are set to 0, which indicates that current implementation does not
   use any security mechanism.  PVD_CO option header ends up with four
   octets long padding filled with zeros.  The rest of the option
   contains encapsulated NDP options that describe particular PvD-
   related network parameters.

   The following NDP options are allowed to appear within the PVD_CO
   option:

   o  Provisioning Domain Identifier option (PVD_ID)

   o  MTU option

   o  Prefix Information option

   o  Route Information option

   o  RDNSS option

   o  DNSSL option

   PVD_ID is a new option introduced to uniquely identify the PvD, while
   others are standard NDP options used in regular non-PvD-aware RA
   messages.

   PVD_ID is mandatory option and MUST be present exactly once per
   PVD_CO option.  If RA message contains multiple PVD_CO options, PvD
   identifiers included in PVD_ID options MUST be unique.  The structure
   of the PVD_ID option is taken from the [....].  Figure 2 shows the
   structure of the PVD_ID option used in proposed MIF architecture
   implementation.

                          Figure 2: PVD_ID option

   In this experimental implementation, the type of the option is set to
   64. [...] proposes several diferent data formats for PvD identifiers,
   including UUID, UTF-8 string, OID, NAI Realm, FQDN, and ULA Prefix.
   Here, UUID is chosen as the only supported format for PvD identifier
   based on the unofficial consensus among members of the IETF MIF WG.
   Since the length of the UUID is fixed to 36 octets, all fields in
   PVD_ID option are of fixed length.  The option itself is always 40
   octets long, therefore the Length field is set to 5, which is a
   multiplier of 8 octets. id-type field is always set to 4, determining
   UUID as the only supported PvD identifier data format.  Consequently,
   id-length field is always set to 36, determining the length of UUID.

   Other options nested within the PVD_CO option follow a standardized
   structure defined in corresponding NDP documents.  Except the MTU
   option, which MAY appear at most once per PVD_CO option, other
   options MAY appear zero or more times per PVD_CO option.

4.2.  Configuration file (radvd.conf) extension

   The behavior of the Router Advertisement Daemon is configured using
   textual configuration file, usually called radvd.conf.  Configuration
   file enables system administrators to specify a wide range of
   configuration parameters, including the frequency at which RA
   messages with network configuration information will be multicasted

   to on-link clients, as well as what information will be included into
   the RA messages.  Configuration parameters are grouped into
   configuration blocks that can roughly be divided into two categories:
   1) interface-level configuration directives that define whether or
   not radvd will announce RA messages on a given interface, timing for
   sending RA messages, client filters, etc., and 2) option-specific
   configuration directives that define the content of particular NDP
   options.  For the purpose of the MIF architecture implementation,
   radvd configuration file is extended with new configuration directive
   which enables definition of the content of the PVD_CO option.

   Figure 3 shows a general structure of the radvd configuration file
   extended with new configuration section for specifying PvD-related
   network configuration information.

     interface name {
         list of interface specific options
         list of prefix definitions
         list of route definitions
         list of RDNSS definitions
         list of DNSSL definitions
         list of LoWPANCo definitions
         list of ABRO definitions

     };

    Figure 3: The structure of the radvd.conf extended with PvD-related
                           configuration section

   Newly introduced configuration section enables definition of network
   configuration parameters for multiple provisioning domains.  One PvD
   definition per provisioning domain MUST be specified in radvd.conf.
   For each PvD definition, radvd generates a separate PVD_CO option in
   RA message.
